If you are using an original wags container (as opposed to cat_wags.sif) with NCBI scaffold IDs, you should use --ref Fca126_mat1.0.

However, if you would you prefer to use updated cat_wags with "nice" scaffold IDs (ie chrA1, chrA2, chrA3), download the container at

wget https://s3.msi.umn.edu/wags/cat_wags.sif

and use --ref Fca126_nice.
